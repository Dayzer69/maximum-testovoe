## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the project repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dayzer69/maximum-testovoe.git
cd maximum-testovoe
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Follow the instructions for your operating
system:

#### Linux / MacOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Tests with Allure Report Generation

To run the tests and generate an Allure report, use the following command:

```bash
pytest --alluredir=./allure-results
```

This will execute all tests in the project and display the results in the terminal.

### Viewing the Allure Report

After the tests have been executed, you can generate and view the Allure report with:

```bash
allure serve allure-results
```

This command will open the Allure report in your default web browser.
